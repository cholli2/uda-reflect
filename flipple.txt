I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing. I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes.  I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.

I play bluegrass cello, and I am the subject of numerous documentaries. I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend 
passes.  Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. 

I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact 
origami. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.
